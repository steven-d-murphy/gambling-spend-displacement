**COICOP overlap**

Codes 1 to 11 align with COICOP 2018: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/unsdclassifications/COICOP_2018_-_pre-edited_white_cover_version_-_2018-12-26.pdf
Reference this to resolve difficulties. Exception: gambling moved from 9 to 14 and 15.

**Dominant-product rule:**  

By default, assign each brand to its primary/dominant category. If a specific product or purpose is explicitly mentioned in the _brand_ (e.g. “car loan”), classify to that product’s code rather than the brand’s default.

**Prioritising input information**

The descriptions are there as supporting information. If it is clear from the brand alone how to classify, do so. If this cannot be done, then make a judgement based on the descriptions. Weight each description equally, but the brand name highest.

**Limiting output information**

There is an output field, 'note'. This should almost always be blank. Only provide information about difficult judgement calls.

**Classification clarifications**

These results will be joined to millions of transactions on the 'brand'. Therefore, you should weight what you know about the brand much more highly than what you see in the descriptions. 
+ If the brand is best known for credit cards, always classify to 12.21 (such as Barclaycard, AMEX and others)
+ Stationary, greetings cards, news and book stores go to 9
+ Large banks such as Barclays and Halifax → 12.20, if the brand contains no information about the financial product used
